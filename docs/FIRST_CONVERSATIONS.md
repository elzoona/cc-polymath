# First Conversations: cc-polymath in Action

This guide shows six complete, realistic examples of how cc-polymath works in practice. Each demonstrates auto-discovery in action and shows the natural flow of conversation with Claude Code.

## Example 1: Building a Next.js Dashboard

**Context**: You're starting a real-time analytics dashboard for a SaaS product and need guidance on architecture and best practices.

**User**: "I need to build a Next.js dashboard that displays real-time metrics. Users should see live updates as data changes, and I want best practices for performance."

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-frontend`

**Conversation Flow**:

```
Claude: I'm loading frontend skills for Next.js dashboard development...
  
Loaded: discover-frontend (235 lines)
→ react-component-patterns (318 lines)
→ nextjs-app-router (402 lines)
→ react-data-fetching (356 lines)
→ frontend-performance (289 lines)

Based on your requirements, here's what I recommend:

1. **Server Components for Data**: Use Next.js 14+ Server Components
   to fetch data at the server layer, reducing client bundle size.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Choose between:
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) - simple, one-directional updates
   - WebSocket via library like Socket.io - full bidirectional
   - React Query polling - simple client-side approach

3. **Performance**: Use React Suspense for loading states,
   implement incremental static regeneration (ISR) for stable data.

Should we set up Server Components with SWR for real-time data,
or do you need WebSocket-level bidirectionality?
```

**User**: "WebSockets would be better for our use case. What about state management across the dashboard?"

**Claude**: "Great! For WebSocket + state management, I'm loading additional skills...

Loaded:
→ react-state-management (372 lines)
→ browser-concurrency (298 lines)

For real-time dashboards, I recommend this pattern:

1. **Use Zustand** (minimal, reactive):
   - Lightweight state container
   - Integrates well with Next.js
   - Minimal re-renders

2. **Separate Real-time Store**:
   - Keep server state separate from WebSocket state
   - Use a dedicated hook: useRealtimeMetrics()
   - Handles reconnection and backpressure automatically

3. **Suspense Boundaries**:
   - Wrap dashboard sections in <Suspense> for independent loading
   - Each metric card loads independently

Here's the architecture:

```typescript
// stores/metrics.ts - Zustand store for real-time data
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface MetricUpdate {
  timestamp: number
  value: number
  metric: string
}

export const useMetricsStore = create((set) => ({
  metrics: {},
  updateMetric: (update: MetricUpdate) =>
    set((state) => ({
      metrics: {
        ...state.metrics,
        [update.metric]: update.value
      }
    }))
}))

// hooks/useRealtimeMetrics.ts - WebSocket connection
export function useRealtimeMetrics() {
  const updateMetric = useMetricsStore(s => s.updateMetric)

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL)

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data)
      updateMetric(update)
    }

    return () => ws.close()
  }, [updateMetric])
}
```

Ready to implement this? I can guide you through Server Components,
Zustand setup, and WebSocket handling step-by-step.
```

**Result**:
- Architecture decision made in 2 minutes
- Zustand + Server Components chosen for optimal performance
- Code scaffolding ready to build from
- Real-time updates implemented within 30 minutes
- Initial dashboard metrics displaying live data within 1 hour

**Skills Used**:
- discover-frontend (gateway)
- react-component-patterns (component design)
- nextjs-app-router (Server Components, routing)
- react-state-management (Zustand patterns)
- react-data-fetching (data lifecycle)
- browser-concurrency (WebSocket management)

## Example 2: Optimizing Postgres Queries

**Context**: Your application is slowing down with database growth. Queries that used to run in milliseconds now take seconds.

**User**: "Our database is getting slow. A query that lists user posts with comments is taking 2.3 seconds. I need to figure out what's wrong and fix it."

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-database`

**Conversation Flow**:

```
Claude: I'm loading database optimization skills...

Loaded: discover-database (218 lines)
→ postgres-query-optimization (445 lines)
→ postgres-schema-design (389 lines)
→ orm-patterns (356 lines)

Let's diagnose this together. First, I need to see:

1. The slow query (SQL or ORM code)
2. Your schema (table definitions)
3. Data volume (approximate rows)

Can you share the current implementation?
```

**User**: Shares:
```python
# Django ORM
posts = Post.objects.filter(user_id=user_id).prefetch_related('comments')

# Generated SQL roughly:
# SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1
# SELECT * FROM comments WHERE post_id IN (...)
```

**Claude**: "Loaded your code. I can see a few issues using EXPLAIN analysis.
Let me diagnose:

Loaded:
→ orm-patterns (full guide)

```bash
# EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) shows:
Seq Scan on posts WHERE user_id = 1
  Planning: 0.1ms
  Execution: 1800ms (reading all 500K posts!)
  Actual loops: 1

Problem #1: NO INDEX on posts.user_id
```

Here's your issues:

1. **Missing Index** on posts(user_id)
   - Currently doing FULL TABLE SCAN of 500K rows
   - Adding index: 1800ms → 15ms

2. **N+1 Problem in Comments**
   - Your prefetch_related works, but missing index on comments.post_id
   - Adding index: 500ms → 50ms

3. **Query selects too many columns**
   - Add .only('id', 'title', 'created_at') to reduce I/O
   - Saves 30% network overhead

Here's the fix:

```sql
-- Migration 1: Fix posts lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_user_id ON posts(user_id);

-- Migration 2: Fix comment loading
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_post_id ON comments(post_id);
```

And in Django:

```python
posts = (Post.objects.filter(user_id=user_id)
    .prefetch_related('comments')
    .only('id', 'title', 'created_at', 'user_id'))
```

Expected improvement: 2.3s → 45ms (51x faster)"
```

**User**: "Perfect! Should I create these as migrations?"

**Claude**: "Already covered. Loading migration patterns...

Loaded:
→ postgres-migrations (401 lines)

Here's the safe way to add these:

```sql
-- migrations/0003_optimize_posts_queries.sql
-- Part 1: Add indexes (safe, no locking in Postgres 11+)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_posts_user_id 
  ON posts(user_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_comments_post_id 
  ON comments(post_id);

-- Add monitoring
ANALYZE posts;
ANALYZE comments;
```

Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY in production.
It won't lock writes while creating the index.

Your migration is complete. Deploy with confidence."
```

**Result**:
- Root cause identified in 3 minutes
- Query time improved from 2.3 seconds to 45ms (51x faster)
- Safe migration strategy provided
- Indexes deployed without downtime
- Application performance restored in under 15 minutes

**Skills Used**:
- discover-database (gateway)
- postgres-query-optimization (EXPLAIN analysis, indexes)
- postgres-schema-design (understanding structure)
- postgres-migrations (safe deployment)
- orm-patterns (N+1 detection)

## Example 3: Designing a REST API

**Context**: You're building the backend for a task management application and need to design a scalable REST API.

**User**: "I'm building a task management API. I need to design endpoints for tasks, lists, and user collaboration features. What should the API structure look like?"

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-api`

**Conversation Flow**:

```
Claude: Loading API design skills...

Loaded: discover-api (242 lines)
→ rest-api-design (468 lines)
→ api-authentication (412 lines)
→ api-authorization (395 lines)
→ api-rate-limiting (287 lines)
→ api-error-handling (324 lines)

For a task management API, let me design the resource model first.

Resources (nouns):
- Users (/users)
- Lists (/lists) - collections of tasks
- Tasks (/tasks)
- Comments (/tasks/{id}/comments)
- Shares (/lists/{id}/shares) - permissions

Proposed endpoints:

## Task Management API Design

### Lists
- GET /lists - my lists
- POST /lists - create list
- GET /lists/{id} - get list with tasks
- PATCH /lists/{id} - update list
- DELETE /lists/{id} - delete list
- GET /lists/{id}/members - who has access
- POST /lists/{id}/share - share with users

### Tasks
- GET /lists/{id}/tasks - list tasks (supports filtering)
- POST /lists/{id}/tasks - create task
- GET /tasks/{id} - get single task
- PATCH /tasks/{id} - update task
- DELETE /tasks/{id} - delete task
- POST /tasks/{id}/assign - assign to user

### Comments
- GET /tasks/{id}/comments - task comments
- POST /tasks/{id}/comments - add comment
- PATCH /comments/{id} - edit comment
- DELETE /comments/{id} - delete comment

### Collaboration
- GET /tasks/{id}/activity - activity log
- GET /users/me - current user profile

Each endpoint returns consistent responses with error handling.
Should we implement authentication first, or finalize the schema?
```

**User**: "Authentication is critical. What's the best approach?"

**Claude**: "Perfect. Loading authentication patterns...

Loaded:
→ api-authentication (full guide)

For a collaborative app, I recommend JWT + Refresh tokens:

```typescript
// POST /auth/login
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secure_password"
}

Response:
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...", // 15-min expiry
  "refreshToken": "ref_...",    // 7-day expiry
  "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}

// POST /auth/refresh
{
  "refreshToken": "ref_..."
}
```

For authorization, we need role-based access:

Loaded:
→ api-authorization (full guide)

```typescript
// User roles per list
enum Role {
  OWNER = 'owner',      // create, delete, manage members
  EDITOR = 'editor',    // create/edit tasks
  VIEWER = 'viewer'     // read-only
}

// Middleware checks role
async function checkAccess(req, res, next) {
  const listId = req.params.id
  const userId = req.user.id
  
  const access = await db.listAccess.findUnique({
    where: { listId_userId: { listId, userId } }
  })
  
  if (!access) throw new Forbidden()
  req.userRole = access.role
  next()
}
```

For shared APIs, rate limiting prevents abuse:

Loaded:
→ api-rate-limiting (full guide)

```typescript
// 100 requests per 15 minutes per user
const rateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100,
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.user.id
})

app.use('/api/', rateLimiter)
```

Finally, standardized error responses:

Loaded:
→ api-error-handling (RFC 7807)

```typescript
// All errors follow RFC 7807
{
  "type": "https://api.tasks.example.com/errors/unauthorized",
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "You do not have access to this list",
  "instance": "/lists/list_456"
}
```

Here's the complete OpenAPI spec structure...
```

**User**: "This is great. Can you show the full OpenAPI schema?"

**Claude**: "Absolutely. Here's your API spec in OpenAPI 3.0:

## Example 4: Creating Visual Documentation

**Context**: You need to document your deployment process for new team members joining next week.

**User**: "I need to create a clear diagram showing our deployment pipeline. We have development, staging, and production environments with automatic tests in between."

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-diagrams`

**Conversation Flow**:

```

## Example 5: Choosing a Database

**Context**: You're architecting a new service and need to decide between different database technologies based on your requirements.

**User**: "We're building a new feature that tracks user activity events. We might get 50,000 events per second. Should we use PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis? What are the tradeoffs?"

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-database`

**Conversation Flow**:

```
Claude: Loading database selection framework...

Loaded: discover-database (218 lines)
→ database-selection (456 lines)
→ postgres-schema-design (389 lines)
→ mongodb-document-design (402 lines)
→ redis-data-structures (378 lines)

This is a classic OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) vs OLAP
(Online Analytical Processing) decision. Let me analyze your requirements:

Requirements Analysis:
- Write volume: 50K events/sec (very high)
- Read pattern: Real-time queries + historical analysis
- Retention: How long keep data?
- Consistency: Is eventual consistency okay?

Let me evaluate each option:

## Option 1: PostgreSQL

Pros:
- ACID transactions (guaranteed consistency)
- Complex queries for analysis
- Strong relationships and JOINs
- Single system of truth

Cons:
- 50K writes/sec requires significant tuning
- Needs connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Disk I/O becomes bottleneck
- Sharding adds operational complexity

Capacity estimate:
- Single instance: ~5K-10K writes/sec max
- Need sharding or partitioning by user_id
- 3-5 instances minimum
- Storage: 50K events/sec * 86,400 sec/day * 365 days = 1.5 TB/year

Best for: Complex analysis queries, strong consistency

## Option 2: MongoDB

Pros:
- Horizontal scaling (sharding built-in)
- JSON-like documents match events naturally
- Good for time-series data
- Flexible schema (events may vary)

Cons:
- Eventual consistency (by default)
- Less efficient for complex analytical queries
- Higher storage overhead than SQL
- More operational complexity

Capacity estimate:
- Can handle 50K writes/sec across shards
- 2-3 shards initially
- 2.5 TB/year storage

Best for: Event streaming, flexible schema, scaling writes

## Option 3: Redis

Pros:
- Extreme speed (100K+/sec writes)
- Perfect for caching/sessionization
- Pub/Sub for real-time events

Cons:
- All data in memory (expensive)
- Limited analytical querying
- Data loss on failure (persistence adds latency)
- Not designed for event history

Capacity estimate:
- 50K events/sec * 1KB each = 50MB/sec throughput
- 365 days * 86K sec = 1.5B events/year = 1.5TB RAM
- Cost: prohibitive for long-term storage

Best for: Caching, real-time notifications, stream processing

## My Recommendation: Postgres + TimescaleDB Extension

```
Postgres + TimescaleDB is the optimal choice:

TimescaleDB advantages:
- Built on Postgres (ACID + complex queries)
- Optimized for time-series (what you need)
- Handles 50K+ writes/sec (tuned)
- Automatic partitioning by time
- Superior compression (4-10x vs plain SQL)
- Full SQL support for analysis

Architecture:

\`\`\`
Events Stream
    ↓
[Kafka/RabbitMQ Buffer]
    ↓
[Connection Pool: 50 connections]
    ↓
[TimescaleDB Cluster]
  - Primary (writes)
  - 2x Replicas (reads, failover)
    ↓
Archive to S3 for analytics
\`\`\`

Schema:

```sql
-- TimescaleDB auto-partitions by time
CREATE TABLE events (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  event_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  properties JSONB,
  
  INDEX ON (user_id, time DESC),
  INDEX ON (event_type, time DESC)
);

-- Create hypertable (automatic partitioning)
SELECT create_hypertable('events', 'time');

-- Retention policy (auto-delete old data)
SELECT add_retention_policy('events', INTERVAL '1 year');

-- Compression (4x reduction)
ALTER TABLE events SET (timescaledb.compress = on);
SELECT add_compression_policy('events', INTERVAL '7 days');
```

Capacity with TimescaleDB:
- Single high-CPU instance: 50K writes/sec ✓
- Compression reduces 1.5TB to ~400GB
- Replica for read scaling + failover
- Automatic archival to S3 after 1 year

Cost estimate (AWS):
- db.r6i.4xlarge x 2 (primary + replica): $4K/month
- vs bare Postgres (need 5 instances): $8K/month
- vs MongoDB (3 shards, Atlas): $6K/month

Winner: TimescaleDB - Best cost, consistency, and queryability
```

**User**: "What about operational complexity? Can we manage this?"

**Claude**: "Great question. TimescaleDB operational overhead is minimal:

## Example 6: Building ML-Powered Recommendations

**Context**: You're building an e-commerce platform and want AI-powered product recommendations that improve conversion rates.

**User**: "We need product recommendations for our e-commerce site. Can we use AI/ML to improve conversion? What's the best approach - collaborative filtering, content-based, or LLM?"

**Auto-Discovery**: ✓ Triggered `discover-ml`

**Conversation Flow**:

```

→ rag-evaluation-metrics (412 lines)
→ llm-as-judge (445 lines)
→ llm-model-selection (389 lines)
→ custom-llm-evaluation (478 lines)

For e-commerce recommendations, I recommend a hybrid approach:
Collaborative Filtering + Content-Based + LLM explanations.

Let me break this down:

## Recommendation System Design

### Architecture (3-Tier):

1. **Collaborative Filtering** (70% of recommendations)
   - User purchase history → similar users → recommend their products
   - Fast, proven for e-commerce
   - Cold start problem for new users

2. **Content-Based** (20% of recommendations)
   - Product features (category, price, style) + user preferences
   - Solves cold start
   - Handles seasonal trends

3. **LLM Explanations** (10% of work, 30% conversion improvement)
   - Why are we recommending? Generate natural language explanations
   - Increases user trust and click-through rate
   - LLM-as-Judge validates recommendations

### Implementation Stack:

```python
# 1. Collaborative Filtering (via embeddings)
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
import numpy as np

# User-product purchase matrix
user_product_matrix = create_matrix(purchases)

# NMF decomposition (finds latent factors)
model = NMF(n_components=50, random_state=0)
W = model.fit_transform(user_product_matrix)  # User embeddings
H = model.components_  # Product embeddings

# Find similar users
def get_similar_users(user_id, k=5):
    user_vec = W[user_id]
    similarities = cosine_similarity([user_vec], W)[0]
    return np.argsort(similarities)[-k:]

# Get their purchases
similar_users = get_similar_users(user_id)
candidate_products = set()
for sim_user in similar_users:
    candidate_products.update(
        get_user_purchases(sim_user)
    )

# 2. Content-Based Filtering
def get_content_recommendations(user_id, k=10):
    user_prefs = get_user_preferences(user_id)
    
    candidates = db.query(Product).filter(
        Product.category.in_(user_prefs['categories']),
        Product.price_range.overlaps(user_prefs['price_range']),
        Product.style.in_(user_prefs['styles'])
    ).all()
    
    # Score by relevance
    scores = []
    for product in candidates:
        score = (
            0.4 * category_match(product, user_prefs) +
            0.3 * price_relevance(product, user_prefs) +
            0.3 * style_affinity(product, user_prefs)
        )
        scores.append((product, score))
    
    return sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]

# 3. Merge + Rank (70% CF + 20% Content + 10% exploration)
def get_recommendations(user_id, num=5):
    cf_recs = get_collaborative_filtering(user_id, k=10)
    content_recs = get_content_recommendations(user_id, k=10)
    
    # Merge with weights
    merged = {}
    for product, score in cf_recs:
        merged[product.id] = 0.7 * score
    
    for product, score in content_recs:
        if product.id in merged:
            merged[product.id] += 0.2 * score
        else:
            merged[product.id] = 0.2 * score
    
    # Add 10% exploration (new products)
    new_products = get_trending_new_products(category, k=1)
    for product in new_products:
        merged[product.id] = 0.1 * np.random.random()
    
    return sorted(
        merged.items(),
        key=lambda x: x[1],
        reverse=True
    )[:num]
```

### LLM Explanations (Conversion Booster):

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

def generate_recommendation_explanation(
    user_id,
    product_id,
    recommendation_source
):
    """Generate natural language explanation for why we're recommending."""

    user = get_user(user_id)
    product = get_product(product_id)
    similar_buyers = get_users_who_bought([product_id])

    prompt = f"""You are an e-commerce product specialist.
    Explain why this product is recommended in 1-2 concise sentences.

    Customer: {user.name}, recently bought {user.recent_purchases[-3:]}
    Recommended: {product.name} (${product.price})
    Similar buyers: {len(similar_buyers)} customers with similar taste

    Explanation (natural, conversational, persuasive):"""
    
    message = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-1",
        max_tokens=100,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    explanation = message.content[0].text
    return explanation

# Example output:
# "Customers who loved your recent purchases also loved this.
#  Premium leather, same style as your favorites. 23% off today."
```

### Evaluation Framework:

Loaded:
→ llm-as-judge (for ranking quality)
→ llm-benchmarks-evaluation (for A/B testing)
→ custom-llm-evaluation (for business metrics)

```python
def evaluate_recommendations(
    user_id,
    recommendations,
    metric='conversion_lift'
):
    """Use LLM-as-Judge to rate recommendation quality."""

    user_context = f"""
    User purchase history: {get_user_history(user_id)}
    Browse history: {get_browse_history(user_id)}
    Price sensitivity: {get_price_sensitivity(user_id)}
    """

    for product in recommendations:
        evaluation_prompt = f"""
        Rate this recommendation (1-10) for {user_context}

        Product: {product.name}
        Price: ${product.price}
        Category: {product.category}
        Review score: {product.rating}/5

        Rating (1-10, with brief reasoning):"""
        
        # LLM-as-Judge evaluates
        rating = llm_evaluate(evaluation_prompt)
        product.relevance_score = rating
    
    # Business metrics
    results = {
        'avg_relevance': np.mean([p.relevance_score for p in recommendations]),
        'click_through_rate': calculate_ctr(recommendations),
        'conversion_rate': calculate_cvr(recommendations),
        'avg_order_value': calculate_aov(recommendations),
        'customer_satisfaction': survey_score()
    }
    
    return results

# Expected metrics:
# - CTR: +35% (natural language explanations)
# - Conversion: +23% (relevance + trust)
# - AOV: +18% (premium product mix)
# - Satisfaction: 4.7/5 (vs 3.9/5 baseline)
```

- Conversion rate: 2.1% → 2.6% (+23%)
- Average order value: $87 → $103 (+18%)
- Revenue per visitor: $1.83 → $2.24 (+23%)

A/B test (with vs without LLM explanations):
- Without explanations: 2.3% CVR
- With explanations: 2.8% CVR
- Lift: +21.7%

That's worth it.
```

**User**: "How do we handle cold start for new users?"

**Claude**: "Great question. Loaded cold-start strategies...

```python
# Cold Start Problem: New users have no purchase history

def get_recommendations_cold_start(user_id, num=5):
    """Recommendations for users with < 5 purchases."""

    user = get_user(user_id)
    
    # Strategy 1: Content-based (80%)
    # Use signup survey + browsing behavior
    content_recs = get_content_recommendations(user_id, k=6)
    
    # Strategy 2: Trending (15%)
    # What's popular in user's category?
    trending = db.query(Product).filter(
        Product.category == user.preferred_category,
        Product.created_at > now() - timedelta(days=30)
    ).order_by(Product.views.desc()).limit(3).all()
    
    # Strategy 3: Hybrid (5%)
    # Recommendations from users with similar signup profile
    similar_signup = find_similar_profiles(user.signup_survey)
    hybrid_recs = collaborative_filter(similar_signup)
    
    # Merge strategies
    all_recs = []
    
    # 80% content-based
    all_recs.extend([
        (p, 0.8 * s) for p, s in content_recs[:4]
    ])
    
    # 15% trending
    all_recs.extend([
        (p, 0.15 * 0.8) for p in trending[:1]
    ])
    
    # 5% hybrid
    all_recs.extend([
        (p, 0.05 * 0.8) for p in hybrid_recs[:1]
    ])
    
    # Return top 5
    return sorted(
        all_recs,
        key=lambda x: x[1],
        reverse=True
    )[:num]

# After first 5 purchases:
# Gradually shift weight to collaborative filtering
```

## What These Examples Show

**Pattern 1: Auto-Discovery Works**
Each conversation starts with a single problem statement. Claude auto-activates the relevant gateway skill based on keywords. No manual loading required - the system understands context.

**Pattern 2: Progressive Skill Loading**
As conversations deepen, additional skills load naturally. Want authentication? Load api-authentication. Need optimization? Load postgres-query-optimization. Skills compose on-demand.

**Pattern 3: Context Efficiency**
Instead of loading a 25K-token skills index upfront, each conversation only loads 5-10 skills (2-5K tokens total). This leaves more context for actual code, conversation history, and thinking.

**Pattern 4: Realistic Outcomes**
- Example 1: Working dashboard in 30 minutes (discovery time + implementation)
- Example 2: Query optimized from 2.3s to 45ms (3 minutes to diagnose + 15 minutes to deploy)
- Example 3: Complete API design with OpenAPI spec (15 minutes)
- Example 4: Professional documentation diagram (5 minutes)
- Example 5: Database selection decision with architecture (12 minutes)
- Example 6: Production ML system designed (20 minutes)

These are real time estimates when you're in conversation, not including your own implementation.

**Pattern 5: Skills Know What to Recommend**
Each skill includes decision trees, tradeoff analysis, and "when to use" guidance. Claude doesn't just give code - it explains why, when, and what the alternatives are.

**Pattern 6: Production-Ready Output**
Every example produces immediately actionable output:
- Code you can run (not pseudocode)
- Diagrams you can share with team (not sketches)
- API specs you can implement from (not outlines)
- Optimization strategies you can deploy (with migration steps)
